# GWTish With Updated Build Files

I used [my project template](https://github.com/jojomickymack/ktxtemplate001) to build this interesting project. It pulls in 
[libktx](https://libktx.github.io/) as a result.

possible improvements
- on screen gamepad for android support
- smooth out issues caused by looking at an object and resuming exploring the room - maybe reset the view to what it was previously before 
looking at the object
- collision detection on walls
- add items on the opposite walls to look at
- make it so the camera is at a fixed height when not looking at something (simulate height perspective) - add 'body' that can be seen when 
looking down
